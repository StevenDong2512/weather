# weather forecast app 

## Description

This app allows users to get the weather information (in metrics format) by entering a city name, and the dashboard will display the current weather infomation (date, weather icon, degree, wind speed and humidity) as well as the forecast for the next five days. 

This app also allows the user to check the weather forecast from their previous search input, for example, I looked up Melbourne's weather then looked up New York; I then want to revisit the forecast for Melbourne, I can simply by clicking on to the city name then it would display the weather information on the dashborard without retyping it in the search bar.
